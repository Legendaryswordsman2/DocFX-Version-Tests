## Installation Steps

<!-- Follow these steps to import and set up BT-CMS in your Unity project:

### 1. Prepare Unity Project
- Open your Unity project or create a new one.
- Ensure **Addressables** and **Naughty Attributes** packages are installed and configured (see Requirements table above).

### 2. Import BT-CMS Package
1. Locate the BT-CMS `.unitypackage` file.  
2. In Unity, go to: `Assets → Import Package → Custom Package…`.  
3. Select the BT-CMS package and click **Import**.  
4. Verify all files are imported (Unity will display a list of assets).

> [!NOTE]  
> During import, ensure **Addressables Settings** are already present in the project to avoid errors.

### 3. Configure Addressables
1. Open Addressables Groups: `Window → Asset Management → Addressables → Groups`.  
2. Check that the **Character Spritesheets** are marked as **Addressable**.  
3. Optional: Create custom groups for better organization (e.g., Characters, Props, UI).

### 4. Verify Package
- Open the `BlazerTech Character Management System` folder in the Project window.  
- Ensure all **Prefabs**, **Scripts**, and **Templates** are present.  
- Test by creating a simple **Unified Character Template** or **Layered Character Template** (see Character Templates page).

### 5. Optional Setup
- Configure any **custom Addressables groups** or **project-specific settings**.  
- Integrate **Character Creator** prefabs into your scenes if needed.

> [!TIP]  
> After installation, it’s a good idea to run the **Sample Scenes** included with BT-CMS to verify everything works correctly before starting your own character setup. -->
