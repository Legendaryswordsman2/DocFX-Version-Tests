# Basic Concepts

This page introduces the **core building blocks** of the Character Management System:  
- [**Character Types**](#character-types) â€“ Define how characters are structured.  
- [**Character Templates**](#character-templates) â€“ Blueprints for creating characters later.  
- [**Character Usage**](#character-usage) â€“ Scripts to load and manage characters.  
- [**Character Creator**](#character-creator) â€“ Modular system for building customizable characters in-game.

## Character Types
A **Character Type** defines how a character works. There are two kinds:

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Unified Character Type** | A single spritesheet containing a fully assembled character. No runtime customization. | Characters with fixed, pre-set appearances. |
| **Layered Character Type** | Multiple spritesheets, each containing one visual layer (body, outfit, hair, etc.). | Customizable player characters, dynamic or randomized NPCs. |

## Character Templates
A **Character Template** is a [Scriptable Object](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html) that acts as a **blueprint** for creating characters later. Templates are supported for both **Unified** and **Layered Characters**.

## Character Usage

### Character Loader Components
Once a **Character Type** has been created it can be loaded using one the following scripts:

| Loader | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| [Layered Character Loader](xref:character-usage#layered-character-loader) | Load pre-existing Layered Characters. |
| [Layered Character Template Loader](xref:character-usage#layered-character-template-loader) | Create/load a Layered Character from a template. |
| [Unified Character Loader](xref:character-usage#unified-character-loader) | Load a Unified Character from a template. |

### Character Shader
A **shader** is used to display characters. Sprites from a base spritesheet are rendered in a component such as a **Sprite Renderer**

If a **Unified Character** is used, the shader takes the single spritesheet of the character and shows that over the **Base Spritesheet**.  
If a **Layered Character** is used, the shader combines all layers into the final rendered character.

## Character Creator
The **Character Creator** is a fully modular creation system designed for **Layered Characters**.  
Easily build a character creation menu into your game using the included scripts and prefabs.

> [!TIP]  
> The **Character Creator** only works with **Layered Characters**. **Unified Characters do not support runtime customization.**

### Example Use Cases
1. **Customizable Player Character** â€“ Easily setup the menu for a single character such as the player character. 
2. **Editing a List of Characters** â€“ Allow players to edit a predefined roster, or manage a dynamic list (create, edit, delete).  

### Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Layer Selectors** | Dropdowns, carousels, tabs, etc. |
| **Character Preview** | Static or animated, with options to rotate or swap animations. |
| **History Tracking** | Every change is logged and can be shown as text or image snapshots. |
| **Randomization** | Randomize the entire character or specific layers. |
| **Character Naming** | Optional name field. |
