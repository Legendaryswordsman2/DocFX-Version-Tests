# Character Usage

The following scripts can be used to load and use characters

- **Layered Character Loader** - Load pre-existing Layered Characters.
- **Layered Character Template Loader** - Create/load a layered character from a template.
- **[Unified Character Loader](#unified-character-loader)** - Load a Unified Character from a template.

---

## The Character Shader

A **shader** is used to display characters. Sprites from the **Base Spritesheet** are rendered in a component such as a **Sprite Renderer**

If a **Unified Character** is used, the shader takes the single spritesheet of the character and shows that over the **Base Spritesheet**.  
If a **Layered Character** is used, the shader combines all layers into the final rendered character.  

> [!NOTE]
> If a **Character Loader** is used the shader will be set automatically.

## Character Loaders

Character loading scripts can be used to load any character you've created regardless of the type. All Character Loaders have these fields:

### References:

| **Renderer** | `Renderer` | Reference to a **Render** component such as a **Sprite Renderer**. Used to apply shader. |
| **Set Animator Controller** | `Bool` | Toggle if an **animator controller** should be applied to animate the character.  |
| **Animator** | `Animator` | Reference to an **Animator** component to apply the animator controller. Only shown if  **Set Animator Controller** is true. |

### Loading Settings:
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Loading Mode** | `Enum` | Option to load character asynchronously or synchronously. |
| **Load Character On Start** | `Bool` | Toggles if the character should be loaded when the **Start** method is called. |
