Once the **Character Type** reference is set, a list of all layers from the referenced type will appear.  
Each layer includes:  
- **Dropdown** â€“ Select which piece to use for the layer.  
- **Search bar** â€“ Narrow results if the list is large.  

### Buttons
- **Resync List** â€“ Rebuilds the layers list and resets all values.  
- **Validate Character Template** â€“ Logs whether the template is valid (`true/false`).
